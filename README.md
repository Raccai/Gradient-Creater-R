# Gradient-Creator-R 🎨🖌️
## What is it? How does it work, huh? 🤔
Before we get into that, you may check it out [here](https://raccai.github.io/Gradient-Creator-R/), [here](https://raccai.github.io/Gradient-Creator-R/), and [here](https://raccai.github.io/Gradient-Creator-R/). <br />
Gradient-Creator-R is a simple gradient creator. You can choose which two colors you want to use, as well as the direction of the gradient. <br />
It's important to note that in order for the direction to work, you have to follow this format, not including the square brackets:
- **[number between 0 and 360]deg**

When you're happy with the gradient, copy the text in the bottom text field by selecting all or simply pressing the "Copy" button next to it. Now you may use it for your css needs. 😎

## How to run? 😭
If you want to run it on your own, clone this repo into your machine and install the necessary dependencies by inputting the following code in the command line while in your cloned version: <br />

```
npm install
```

When that's done, input the following code and you're all good: <br />

```
npm run dev
```

Enjoy the colors! 🎨🖌️😎
